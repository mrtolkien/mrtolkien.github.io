# RNG

[DATA LINK](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TUE085BmLPy-ZNTVy61Exgrm1i8vaySlQsj_JPZDKDE/edit?usp=sharing)

## Team Stats
- Poor GD@15 against HLE
- Average GD@15 overall
- Very long game even after a strong early game

TL;DR: Average to poor stats

## Players Stats

Xiaohu
- Absolute monster so far, shining point of the team
- One of the highest jungle proximity for a top laner, especially in their wins
- At his scariest on ranged champions

Wei
- Low support proximity, explained by his top focus
- Does worse in bloody games

Crying
- The inter
- Does get a high jungle and support proximity
- Low damage share

Both solo laners struggle on melee champions

Bot lane
- Almost no kills before 15

## Conclusion

Unimpressive team that succeeds when they snowball Xiaohu
Disjointed jgl/supp/mid early

# EDG

[DATA LINK](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11b17VPXljwtZumuy9fqCCCrRiUWuVewCMa-9lPnjj6c/edit?usp=sharing)

## Team Stats

- Poor early-game performance, including a low GD@15 vs DFM
- Decent mid-game, coming back from early deficit twice and closing before 30 minutes

## Players stats

Flandre
- Consistent, high damage share, low jungle and support proximity
- Low early kills and deaths
- Overall, a rock

JieJie
- He's the inter
- GD@15 jungler
- Very low support proximity
- Nonviolent jungler, 1.2 K+A@15 average

Scout
- Average+, just consistent and doing his job
- Pretty low damage share, but also low support proximity
- In losses, Meiko did not even show up mid

Bot lane
- Poor early game stats
- Low damage share
- 83% support proximity in losses: they rage 2v2

## Conclusion
- They don't understand their own strenght and try to force playing through bot
- Poor adaptation to the game state
- Their best chance to win is to actually play for their solo lanes, which is the foil to RNG

# Match-up analysis

- The deciding factor of this series is going to be the toplane

- RNG has a big advantage because they properly understand their strenghts and play to it

- EDG can take it if they adapt and properly support Scout and Flandre
	- Scout can get a lead if Meiko helps him instead of babysitting Viper
