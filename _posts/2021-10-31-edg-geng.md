# EDG

Looking only at Worlds games (moar data)

## Team trends

Won every game where they had a lead at 15
Lost 4 out of 5 games where they were behind at 15

-> early-game reliant team, but looks to have a strong early game

Very fast games, with 7 of their games ending before 30 minutes

Fast and loose team
	
## Players trend

### Flandre

- Still the secret carry, performing reliably with low investment from his team
- A rock, and a hard one at that

### JieJie

- Higher variance, does great when games get bloody
- Needs to find those early kills with Meiko to make it work

### Scout

- A second support to the team
- Helped by JieJie but inexistant damage -> he uses his advantage to get Viper ahead

### Bot lane

- Highly volatile
- They're the ones inting in losses
- JieJie is camping for them super hard

## Conclusion

YOLO team which wins if they find kills bot early
They *will* try and kill you bot and *will* die for it

# Gen.G

## Team trends

They lose more slowly than they win
-> Look good at stalling (maybe due to all the Azir)

Not too reliant on early leads but also not great at creating them

## Players trends

### Rascal

Decidedly average, not bad but not good either
Doing his job of being completely ignored

### Clid

Decidedly average, not bad but not good either
Gen.G wins when he's playing with his support (much wow)

### Bdd

Kinda smashed perkz which props up his stats
Average+, which is better than his top and jungle
#1 damage dealer in their wins, which is telling a lot when you have Ruler

Get more help from his jungle and support than Scout
Looks like the actual carry of the team, and his team properly identified it

### Bot lane

Not that high of a support proximity compared to EDG
Ruler is a consistent great performer who does not get as much attention as one would think

# Conclusion

- Top is in EDG's favor and junglers are not showing up there
- Mid is Gen.G favored but Scout doesn't really care
- Gen.G's bot is more consistent but I'm not sure they'll be ready to match the bot commitment of EDG
