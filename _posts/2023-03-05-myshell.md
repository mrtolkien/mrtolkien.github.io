The older I get, the more I enjoy just doing as much as I can in a terminal. There's something about the lack of distractions, simplicity of the interface, and speed.

And I'm not the only one. Well-loved tools like `ls` and even `bash` have been great, but now faster and overall better solutions exist.

I recently had to re-do my whole setup as I moved my work setup from x64 Windows to ARM Macs and of course I spent way too much time trying out all options.

So let's take a look at what my terminal environment looks like in 2023, and see how much of it is written in Rust (spoiler: almost everything).

# Terminal Emulator

I'm a normie. For years I just used `Terminal.app` on Mac OS, and when they realed `Windows Terminal` on Windows I just started using that. They mostly did their job and came with decent standards for their systems.

But the Mac terminal had a few shortcomings that I didn't want to deal with. Its configuration is cumbersome.

So I gave [`warp.dev`](https://www.warp.dev/) a try. And it really is incredible. It feels like a whole new terminal usage paradigm. The autocomplete is great, it all looks great, being able to share snippets is super convenient. Overall, it's a home run, except:

- It does not support sub-shells, so `poetry shell` or `psql` break everything
- It does not support Vim bindings for input editing
- Text selection is still cumbersome

Which made me go to the other extreme, [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty). Pure Rust multiplatform terminal emulator.

Blazingly fast, super small (5MB), configurable through a `.yml` file, it was really all I wanted. It took me ~30 minutes sifting through the whole configuration to really make it behave like I expected but it's been great since then!

# Shell

I've been using `zsh` for a decade now. Ever since it became the default on Mac OS it made me miss it every time I went back to `bash`. While it's less features-packed than `fish`, its simplicity, extensibility, and plugins made it my favorite.

You know me though, I *had* to give a shiny new toy a try: enter [`Nushell`](https://www.nushell.sh/).

`Nushell` is a shell written entirely in Rust where commands output can be structured. It lets you do stuff like this:

![nushell example](assets/images/nu_shell.png)

While `grep` (or `ripgred` as we'll see later) can do a lot of cool things, `nushell` lets you see command output like it was an SQL table or JSON.

It also comes with a set of great defaults and many other features, and is extensible via the `nu` programming language. It also has the best `vim` support of any shell I have ever used. And it's multi-platform, meaning it also works natively on Windows.

But like `warp`, being shiny and new does come with some downsides:

- Completions are just not there yet
- The plugins ecosystem is still very young
- It's not `bash`/`zsh` and it will take some time to adapt + shell excerpts you see online will require editing to work

Overall, I liked it, but not enough to make the full switch yet. The poor completions was the biggest issue for me. I like it when my shell does my job for me!

# Plugins management and completions

Ever since I've used `zsh`, I've coupled it with [`oh-my-zsh`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) to manage plugins and themes. It's been decent, even though a lot of plugins I enjoy (syntax highlighting and suggestions) need to jump through a few hoops to be installed.

As I was back to Mac OS, I gave [`fig`](https://fig.io/) a second shot. I had quickly installed it years ago on my Macbook Air but uninstalled it as I was not comfortable with it overwriting some of my `oh-my-zsh` completions and configs.

Honestly, I'm sold. As a completion engine, it's the best solution for most shells. It has great support for most programs all with a sleek interface and a few nice added bonus:

- `alias` management
- `zsh` plugins management
- `ssh` hosts and plugins management

It works really well for what it does. Interestingly their selling feature, scripts, is the only one I absolutely have no care for.

If `fig` worked inside `nushell` and allowed me to fix the completion issues there, I'd switch to `nushell`, but unfortunately it only supports `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish`.

I currently use the following `zsh` plugins managed through `fig`:

- `zsh-vi-mode`
- `zsh-completions`
- `zsh-aliases-exa` (we'll talk about `exa` soon)
- `zsh-autosuggestions`
- `zsh-syntax-highlighting`
- `git-open`

# Prompt and font

Of course, I used [`powerlevel10k`](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) like a real 1337 HAX0R. It looks great, is heavily configurable through arcane means, and works well with `zsh`.

But then I heard about [`starship`](https://starship.rs/):

- Rust-based == super fast
- Cross-shell support
- Tons of features out of the box
- Easily configurable

As soon as I installed it, I was sold. It's much easier to install and setup while being faster, having more features, and working on all shells.

Sorry `powerlevel10k`. You were the best.

With a prompt comes a font. A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/#home) to be precise.

In the past I used Meslo Nerd Font as it was the recommended one for `powerlevel10k`. But now I was freed, which is usually is a bad idea seeing how much I like to try out stuff.

After way too much experimentation I landed of the [`JetBrains Mono`](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) patched with the complete nerdfonts package. You can easily [download it here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads), and I also use it in my IDE.

# CLI tools

## GNU coreutils replacements

- `ls` -> [`exa`](https://github.com/ogham/exa)
- `cat` -> [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- `du` -> [`dust`](https://github.com/bootandy/dust)

You can go deeper and use the whole [`coreutils` Rust replacement](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils), but those try to be compatible the GNU coreutils and therefore don't add cool new features like making the output readable.

# Search

`grep` is one of the most useful commands in `bash`-like shells. So what about using [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), its super-charged Rust cousin?

It's up to 200 times faster which is great when searching things in huge files. Something that happens often in my line of work!

Its output is also much nice so there's that. Use it, love it!

## Filesystem jumping and viewing

I used [`z`](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z) for years now and I honestly can't use a shell without it. Jumping to directories in a few keystrokes from everywhere is just too convenient.

While re-doing my setup, I came accross [`zoxide`](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) and I new I had found the holy grail: a Rust re-implementation of `z`!

Not much to say except that it's all I ever wanted, and it's perfectly cross-platform thanks to Rust. My [oxydation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFkGNe4oaKk) is well underway.

I'm also using [`joshuto`](https://github.com/kamiyaa/joshuto) relatively regularly to move files around. It's a `ranger`-like terminal file manager, except it works.

[`broot`](https://github.com/Canop/broot) is another nice alternative in Rust!

## Documentation

[`tldr`](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) is a godsend for many commands. Even with `fig` autocomplete, having a short documentation helps so much!

## Git

[`lazygit`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) has completely supplanted my use of the VSCode interface or `git` CLI. It's very fast and offers easy access to all the `git` features I use!

## Tabs and sessions

`Alacritty` does not support tabs. It does not really change anything for me as I simply open a new window when I need multiple tabs. But what if you actually want tabs in your shell?

Then [`zellij`](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) is your friend. It's like `tmux` but with great defaults and a wasteful (but nice) user interface.

I really like it on servers when running background tasks as I find it much more ergonomic than `tmux`!

# Conclusion

I'm not a Rust fanatic, but Rust tools are really taking over my terminal. Let's do a quick recap:

| Type              | Program              | Language                                                           | Notes                |

| Git               | `lazygit`            | Go                                                                 |                      |
| Search            | `ripgrep`            | Rust                                                               |                      |
| Coreutils         | `bat`, `exa`, `dust` | Rust                                                               |                      |

I'm pretty satisfied about my stack honestly, and the only things I expect to change in the future are:

- Switch to `nushell`
- Switch to `warp.dev` once it really offers a full Vim-like workflow
- `fig` replacement for an open source alternative at some point
- My terminal file explorer, I can do better!
