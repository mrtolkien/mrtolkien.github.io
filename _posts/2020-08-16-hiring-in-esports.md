In every field hiring can make or break a company. Finding the right talent for your team is a challenge, and even for mainstream skill sets it is getting constantly refined.

So in a field as young as esports you can imagine how hard it is. Nobody really knows what makes a great esports player or coach yet. We can intuit it, but putting it into words and creating the proper hiring process to find those people is much harder.

I would go as far as saying that the most successful teams are the ones that have the best hiring processes. Ocelote of G2 Esports is a prime example of a owner having the proper experience and background to be able to identify the right players and coaches, and it has been paying off for years in multiple titles. More discreetly, Peter Dun’s focus on talent scouting brought Splyce to a Worlds Top 8 in 2019 and will likely bring MAD Lions to another one in 2020 after changing 4 out of 5 players. The advantage you get from having hired the right people from the start is very hard to offset, and is in my eyes one of the reasons some bigger organizations have been struggling.

Having created my own esports team in 2017 and failed due to poor recruitment, as well as having been hired in both a European and a Korean team since, I have a unique insight in how esports hiring works. I wish I had done things differently for my team, and I also wish other teams refined their hiring processes to give both new players and coaching staff a better chance to succeed. Let’s see where the market is at, and how I think it can be improved.

# The current state of things

## Talent discovery

In my opinion, there is a very simple reason why China and Europe are miles ahead of both Korea and North America right now. It all boils down to those region’s ability to hire the right players.

While American and Korean teams focus their hiring process on ranked play, European and Chinese teams have the luxury to look at their mature secondary leagues. Players succeeding in secondary leagues show they have what it takes to succeed in a team environment, and those secondary leagues coaches and teammates can be contacted to properly assess a player’s character.

There have been tons of example of players being ranked gods not translating well to professional play, and equally as many examples of players striving in teams without being particularly noticeable on ranked play. The recent failure of Korean and American teams is in my opinion stemmed in them not understanding that ranked play and professional play are different games, and still relying too much on ranked play for talent discovery.

A good parallel would be chess, where blitz ratings and traditional ratings are pretty far apart.  While there are of course many transferable skills, the games are still different enough that the **best** at each are different. And being the absolute best is all that matters for an esports team.
