# C9

## Team Stats

Played a lot of relatively "weaker" opponents in the past months, but do not have stats that match it:
- 14 times between -2k and +2k at 15 in their wins
- Rarely completely smash early (5 games out of 35)

## Players Stats

Fudge:
- Stats don't look great, and they do worse when they play with him early
- Is not a reliable damage source even on damage-oriented champions
	- 22% dmg share in their wins as GP, his best champ

Blaber:
- Great stats, lots of early action and GD@15 in their wins
- Very high support proximity
- Looks like a standout player, but maybe a bit too reliant on kills to get his team ahead

Perkz:
- The main carry in their wins, but gets insane help from both support and jungle
- C9 is reliant on Perkz's success to win games

Zven:
- Consistence incarnated:
	- Same D@15 in wins and losses, low sup proximity, high consistent damage share
- Does much better when there is some successful action bot early

# Conclusion
- C9's successful plan is to support Perkz with jgl + sup and use this pressure to dive bot
- Simply put, they're one of the most "by the book" team in terms of overarching goal
	- C9 wins when they find early kills bot, loses when they don't

# Gen G

## Team Stats

- Closes out games fast and drags out their losses (which is good)
- Average+ GD@15 stats
	- They never totally smash early but also rarely get smashed
- Their stats do corroborate their ResidentSleeper status

## Players Stats

Rascal:
- Average stats incarnated: not ahead, not behind, not too much damage, not too little
- A solid player that is not really part of the early-game plans of the team

Burdol:
- Turbo inted in their losses with an **average** -2060 GD@15 in those
- We're not seeing Burdol tonight except if Gen.G want to BM Cloud 9

Clid:
- Solid consistent player
- Does much better when he actually plays with Life
	- 26% sup prox in wins, 20% in lossses

Bdd:
- The crux of Gen.G, they win when he's ahead and lose when he's behind
- The true carry behing Gen.G's wins, with a 29% damage share in those
- Despite this, does not get enough early-game help from his support

Bot lane:
- Ruler is very good and consistently gets ahead, but does require more attention from his support
- High damage share but still below Bdd in wins, telling me he gets a bit more resources than needed

# Conclusion

- C9 is much more reliant on their early game to win than Gen.G
	- They get ahead as a team, but also behind as a team
- This series will be decided on mid 3v3 and Cloud 9 can actually make it work


3-1 Gen.G, C9 wins one through Perkz carrying after a successful hardcore camp from Vulcan and Blaber
