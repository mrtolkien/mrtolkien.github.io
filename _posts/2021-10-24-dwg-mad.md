# DWG

Khan:
- HE'S A GIGA, ULTIMATE, TURBO INTER
- 30% damage in wins, 20% in losses
- 3% support proximity, maybe the lowest in the world
- 14% jungle proximity, which is actually high for a top laner

Canyon:
- Underperformer in losses, but ok stats in wins
- Relatively low support proximity
- Average+ stats, but nothing really great

ShowMaker:
- Doesn't die much, but does not do much
	- Low damage share in wins, high in losses
	- Low jungle and support proximity, hinting to a disjointed early game
- Just like Canyon, it's average+

Bot lane:
- In their losses, have a higher jgl-bot proximity and sup-bot proximity
	- They do worse when they play for bot

## Conclusion
- They win through top and they properly play for it
- Their bot is OK but they do not really rely on it for carrying
- MAD can either hard match top or sack top and try to snowball bot

- Very "flat" stats despite high number of wins -> They win through mid/late game, not early

# MAD

ARRRRRMUT:
- Good, stable stats
- They do better when he's involved early, but overall he's a stable, strong role player

Elyoya:
- Great K+A@15 in wins (~4)
- Very low GD@15 in losses (-705)
- Looks to be tryning too hard to play for kills, falters when it does not work
- 28% stable support proximity: they're glued together

Humanoid:
- Above-average supp and jgl proximity, above-average damage share but not OP (especially in wins)
- Average stats everywhere else, kinda ints early in losses

Bot lane:
- Low supp-bot proximity, lots of roaming
- Horrendous early-game stats from Carzzy, but highest damage share in the team
- Kaiser is as flippy as Elyoya

# CONCLUSION
- Two teams that let their bot lane fend for themselves and play for solo lanes
	- MAD is more focused on mid while DWG is looking at top
- JGL/SUP from MAD are imo too flippy to succeed against DWG
- Their strenghts do not match in the right places imo, MAD could win through bot they have not shown it in the past

3-1 DWG, MAD wins one by snowballing top
