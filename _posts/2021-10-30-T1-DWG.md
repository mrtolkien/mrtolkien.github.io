# T1

## Team

- Great early game (+1k average GD@15, only once behind by more than -2000 G@15)
	- Heavily reliant on their early game to win
- Very fast team at closing games out
- Looks to be playing fast and loose


## Players


### Canna
- #1 damage share of the team, explained by the snowball into quick closing of games
- Not many kills or deaths @ 15 but a W I D E GD@15, highest in the team
	- Dies twice as much early in their losses
- Above average jungle proximity, especially in their losses
	- Tells me that T1 realizes they're reliant on him to succeed

### Oner
- Despite the early-game tendencies of the team, relatively low early kills and assists
- Much higher support proximity in wins
	- This kinda tells me they're not really in sync if they don't *always* have this proximity

### Faker
- Accepted being a roleplayer and giving TOP/BOT the opportunity to carry
- Very average JGL/SUP proximity, not getting particularly high attention from his team
- He's the one that gets behind in losses
	- Maybe he'd benefit from a bit more support in losses

### Bot lane
- A great GD@15 botlane that finds few early kills
- Opposite of Canna, they get more help from the jungler in wins
- BOT/SUPP proximity is normal around 60%

## Conclusion

- I think T1 is reliant on Canna snowballing *alone*, with only 1/2 ganks from Oner
- Then, Oner can use his pressure bot, where Keria and Gumayusi create a huge lead that lets Canna push his 1v1 lead
- Faker gets left out to dry when he has a bad start, and the team crumbles because of it as they play for sides

# T1 vs DWG

- This game is gonna be a 2v2 top before 10 minutes every game
- Canna should hold his own against Khan and might even have a stronger early-game with Oner
- T1 should be better at winning through bot if it stays a pure 2v2
- Mid laners role will be to support their sides

The two teams are evenly matched, but if T1 plays it properly I think they take in 3/2 or 3/1.

T1 needs to:
- Make sure Canna gets ahead early and requires attention from Canyon
- Give Faker proper support from Oner and Keria
- Use their advantage 2v2 bot to capitalize on it once Canyon is pulled top
