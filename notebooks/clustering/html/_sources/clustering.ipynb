    "# Clustering Legends of Runeterra archetypes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list of `n` [Legends of Runeterra](https://playruneterra.com/en-sg/) decks, how to automatically group them into **archetypes**, *ie* groups of similar decks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering decks as archetypes allows for better calculation of metrics like win-rate and play-rate. This is a problem that comes back for every card game I have ever played, and is usually \"simply\" solved by humans sort the decks themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if deck clustering could be automated?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "I started to think about how to \"simply\" group decklists. Two ways came to mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choosing decks that have a pool of common cards\n",
    "- Choosing decks that have few different cards\n",
    "\n",
    "Whichever distance we choose, we can start from individual decks and add new decks one by one, selecting the \"closest\" one to the cluster at each step. We can do this process in descending popularity order, so ties are broken by the popularity of decks. We can then select the biggest non-overlapping clusters found as good archetypes and re-start the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does sound pretty close to k-means as it also relies on a centroid vector for each cluster, but here we don't have to select how many clusters we want from the start. We can also have clusters of very different sizes and it will not be an issue with our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll call that method **incremental constrained cluster growth** and it's the one I'll be implementing in this blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Existing clustering algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustery analysis is a complex and heavily researched domain. Algorithms usually exhibit `O(n**3)` complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular clustering algorithm, or at least the only one I remember from my M.Sc., is [k-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). It's unfortunately a pretty poor fit here as we don't know the number of archetypes/clusters we are looking for, and it's also poorly adapted for clusters of vastly different sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hierarchical clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering) is a better fit for our use-case:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In data mining and statistics, hierarchical clustering (also called hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA) is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deck archetypes naturally have multiple levels of \"granularity\" we can look at. From big macro archetypes being defined only by a few cards to micro archetypes arising from very few card differences. Ordering them in a hierarchy sounds like a great fit even though it will be harder to use for visualisation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try hierarchical clustering and visualisation at some point, but I'm keeping it for a future blog post!\n"

    "## Preparing data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Games selection\n",
    "\n",
    "As Legends of Runeterra does not offer access to ranks through its API, I use [TrueSkill](https://trueskill.org/) to identify the best players on a given server and parse them in descending skill order. I only use ranked results to determine skill ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "I verified the algorithm by verifying that the best players identified by TrueSkill were indeed in Master rank. We can do that by checking account names, which is the only type of rank data available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows me to parse games for the ~20 000 best players per server, which returns ~35 000 ranked games per day per server. As there are 3 servers in total, we have ~100 000 games per day of data. This likely covers rank until platinum, and maybe even gold. But we have no way to check as LoR's API doesn't let us query ranks for players ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL query\n",
    "\n",
    "The data parsed from Riot's API is susceptible to regular model changes and I've therefore saved it as a `JSONB` column in `Postgres`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have written that query in many different ways but in the end making a subquery to create a `player` table was the easiest for me to maintain. I'm sure this query can be written in a smarter way but I'm still only starting to get used to `JSONB` direct querying with Postgres:\n",

    "- Re-start iteration with any remaining decks\n",
    "\n",
    "The **archetype** will be the aggregate decklist as defined by [Frank Karsten's in this ChannelFireball article](https://strategy.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/mtg/channelmagic-articles/magic-math-a-new-way-to-determine-an-aggregate-deck-list-rg-dragons/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Things that didn't work out\n",
    "\n",
    "- With a direct implementation, computational time was through the roof at **~24h with ~20,000 decks**\n",
    "  - Complexity `O(n**3)` does that\n",
    "- Even with multiple optimisations and shortcuts the method was still way too heavy and took multiple hours for each iteration\n",

    "  - It did heavily speed up the process at the cost of clustering quality\n",

    "\n",
    "### Deck factions\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing to add was \"pre-clustering\". `O(n**3)` complexity means that if we're able to split the data into 100 sets, complexity goes down by 1,000,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there are 100 obvious sets for our data: the deck's factions. Those are similar to deck colors in Magic or hero in Hearthstone.\n",

    "Forcing all decks in an archetypes to be the same factions does lose some granularity for decks that just splash 3/6 cards in a different faction, but it's actually something we *want*. The end goal is identifying success of different strategies, and changing a splash in a deck is a new strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplification also allowed me to drop the fast cutoff idea as I was working with much smaller lists of decks to cluster at each step."

    "I initially implemented it wrongly, which cost me a lot of time.\n",

    "What really matters to us is the distance of a deck to a cluster, so it's even easier to implement all those as part of a `Cluster` class.\n",
